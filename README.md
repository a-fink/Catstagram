# Catsagram Project

## Goal
To build a single-page social media esque site. Users can view a random cat image drawn from the `https://thecatapi.com/` API.
Users can then upvote/downvote it and make comments about it. All of which are then stored in session storage and retrieved if the user refreshes the page.
Users can also ask for a new cat image which clears all stored values and allows for new upvoting/downvoting and commenting.

Please see assignment and phase readme's for project's given instructions.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript - build/manipulate elements & styling, write/read from session storage, fetch from an API and parse the response
- replit.com - for hosting that allows a custom http node.js server
